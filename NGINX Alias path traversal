Description

NGINX is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.
The NGINX alias directive defines a replacement for the specified location.
For example, with the following configuration:

location /i/ {
    alias /data/w3/images/;
}

on request of /i/top.gif, the file /data/w3/images/top.gif will be sent.

But, if the location doesn't ends with directory separator (i.e. /):

location /i {
    alias /data/w3/images/;
}

on request of /i../app/config.py, the file /data/w3/app/config.py will be sent.

The incorrect configuration of the alias could allow an attacker to read file stored outside the target folder.
