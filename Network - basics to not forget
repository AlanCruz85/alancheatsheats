If my laptop want to connect to google.com:

1 - It asks to DNS: who is google.com? DNS will respond with the ip addr.
2 - My laptop will check in the arp table and, in case it doesn't have the information, will broadcast: who has this ip?
3 - Nobody responding, will send to the default gateway, that will check its arp table and send to another router, and so on.

Switch, usually, doesn't have an arp table. Arp table is related to IP (layer 3), and switch operates in layer 2. The hosts are those who, before sending the packets, check the arp table.
Switch checks mac table (mac addr related to a port). If it doesn't have the information, will relay the packet to everybody and, when receiving the answer, will update the mac table.
