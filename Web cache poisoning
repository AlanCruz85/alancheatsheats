 If a server had to send a new response to every single HTTP request separately, this would likely overload the server, resulting in latency issues and a poor user experience, especially during busy periods. Caching is primarily a means of reducing such issues.

The cache sits between the server and the user, where it saves (caches) the responses to particular requests, usually for a fixed amount of time. If another user then sends an equivalent request, the cache simply serves a copy of the cached response directly to the user, without any interaction from the back-end. This greatly eases the load on the server by reducing the number of duplicate requests it has to handle.

The keyword is "X-Cache" as a response header.


CDN (Content Delivery Network) adds X-cache header to HTTP Response. X-cache:HIT means that your request was served by CDN, not origin servers. CDN is a special network designed to cache content, so that usr request served faster + to unload origin servers.

X-Cache corresponds to the result, whether the proxy has served the result from cache (HIT for yes, and MISS for no)
X-Cache-Lookup represents if the proxy has a cache-able response to the request (HIT for yes and MISS for no)
