From CHATGPT:

"Yes, you're correct in observing that LDAP search operations can be used in two different types of authentication scenarios:

    Server-Side LDAP Search Operation for Authentication:
        In this scenario, the server (typically a service or application) uses an LDAP search operation to query Active Directory or another LDAP directory to authenticate a client user before allowing access to its resources.
        The server may perform an LDAP search to validate the user's credentials (e.g., username and password) against the directory. If the search is successful, the user is considered authenticated and is granted access.

    Client-Side LDAP Search Operation Before Kerberos Authentication:
        In this scenario, the client software performs an LDAP search operation to obtain information necessary for Kerberos authentication.
        For example, the client may query the directory to retrieve Service Principal Names (SPNs) associated with services it intends to access.
        After obtaining the necessary information, the client can then request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC) as part of the Kerberos authentication process."
