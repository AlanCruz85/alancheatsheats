LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network -- whether on the public Internet or on a corporate Intranet. LDAP is a "lightweight" (smaller amount of code) version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which is part of X.500, a standard for directory services in a network.

A directory tells the user where in the network something is located. On TCP/IP networks (including the internet), the domain name system (DNS) is the directory system used to relate the domain name to a specific network address (a unique location on the network). However, the user may not know the domain name. LDAP allows a user to search for an individual without knowing where they're located (although additional information will help with the search).
Uses of LDAP

The common use of LDAP is to provide a central place for authentication -- meaning it stores usernames and passwords. LDAP can then be used in different applications or services to validate users with a plugin. As some examples, LDAP can be used to validate usernames and passwords with Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Open VPN and Linux Samba servers. LDAP single sign-on can also be used by system administrators to control access to an LDAP database.

LDAP AUTHENTICATION
HTB phonebook: "...Therefore, looking at the login page for hints, I see that note from Reese stated that we can login using the workstationâ€™s username and password. This gives us a hint that it is probably using LDAP authentication. To test if we can login, I used:

username: *
password: * 
"
The * is following the REGEX logic. In this particular case, it is like a wild card.
