Docker escape:
If you are part of the group (docker), you can escape using the command similar to:
		docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
If is not the case: Try to find a process runing that communicates with the main computer.

Understanding how docker works:

The key difference between the Dockerfile and docker-compose is that the Dockerfile describes how to build Docker images, while docker-compose is used to run Docker containers. The contents of a Dockerfile describe how to create and build a Docker image, while docker-compose is a command that runs Docker containers based on settings described in a docker-compose.yaml file.

To create a new, custom image based on this example Dockerfile, run the docker build command:
$ docker build -t my-nginx-image:latest .

Note that the dot at the end tells the docker build command to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory. 
The Dockerfile is like a recipe that describes the steps the docker build command must follow to cook up a new, custom Docker image.

Example of a Dockerfile:

FROM alpine:edge
# Setup user
RUN adduser -D -u 1000 -g 1000 -s /bin/sh www
# Install system packages
RUN apk add --no-cache --update supervisor nginx build-base openssl-dev
# Configure php-fpm and nginx
COPY config/fpm.conf /etc/php7/php-fpm.conf
COPY config/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf
COPY config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Setup permissions
COPY --chown=www:www challenge /www
RUN chown -R www:www /var/lib/nginx
#####################################

Unlike the Dockerfile, the docker-compose command and the docker-compose.yaml file the command depends upon are not used to actually build Docker images. Instead, docker-compose is used to describe how to run Docker images as containers.

For example, a docker-compose.yaml file that describes how to run the image created with the Dockerfile above might look like this:

version: '3.9'
services:
  my-nginx-service:
    container_name: my-website
    image: my-nginx-image:latest
    cpus: 1.5
    mem_limit: 2048m
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
