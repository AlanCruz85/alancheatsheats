Just to remember if I find one of these, using BloodHound:


    ForceChangePassword abused with Set-DomainUserPassword
    Add Members abused with Add-DomainGroupMember
    GenericAll abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
    GenericWrite abused with Set-DomainObject
    WriteOwner abused with Set-DomainObjectOwner
    WriteDACL abused with Add-DomainObjectACL
    AllExtendedRights abused with Set-DomainUserPassword or Add-DomainGroupMember
    Addself abused with Add-DomainGroupMember
    DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol
    
An example, just to remember me:
    
    1: We enumerated objects that the user wley has control over and found that we could force change the password of the user damundsen
    2: From here, we found that the damundsen user can add a member to the Help Desk Level 1 group using GenericWrite privileges
    3: The Help Desk Level 1 group is nested into the Information Technology group, which grants members of that group any rights provisioned to the Information Technology group

Using PowerView, it seems to be something like: Get-..., or Set-..., or Add-...
Ex: Add-DomainGroupMember
    Get-DomainGroupMember
    Set-DomainUserPassword
    Set-DomainObject
