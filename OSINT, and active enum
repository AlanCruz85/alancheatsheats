PASSIVE ENUMERATION / OSINT

<< Need to practice more using GOOGLE DORKS >>  

Besides the customer's scoping document, this is our primary source of information, so we want to ensure we are leaving no stone unturned. When starting our enumeration, we will first use passive resources, starting wide in scope and narrowing down. Once we exhaust our initial run of passive enumeration, we will need to examine the results and then move into our active enumeration phase.

What to search

IP Space: 
Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.

Domain Information: 	
Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)

Schema Format: 	
Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.

Data Disclosures: 	
For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)

Breach Data: 	
Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

How/where to search:

ASN / IP registrars: 	
IANA, arin for searching the Americas, RIPE for searching in Europe, BGP Toolkit

Domain Registrars & DNS: 	
Domaintools, PTRArchive, ICANN, manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.

Social Media: 	
Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.

Public-Facing Company Websites: 	
Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.



Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces: 	
GitHub, AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers, Google searches using "Dorks"

Breach Data Sources: 	
HaveIBeenPwned to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, Dehashed to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.

ACTIVE ENUMERATION

To scan multiple ips:
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23

To scan the ips founded:
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum

NetBIOS_Domain_Name: INLANEFREIGHT
NetBIOS_Computer_Name: ACADEMY-EA-DC01
DNS_Domain_Name: INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
DNS_Computer_Name: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
DNS_Tree_Name: INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Domain name, either in NetBIOS (network) and in Active diretory, means the group. Computer_name is specific of that computer.
DC01 means domain controler.
"Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.)"

PASSWORD SPRAYING 
(AVOID USING BRUTEFORCE AGAINS 1 USER. PASSWORD SPRAYING IS BETTER!)
Source: https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/143/section/1490

"Remember that sometimes we will not be able to obtain the password policy if we are performing external password spraying (or if we are on an internal assessment and cannot retrieve the policy using any of the methods shown here). In these cases, we MUST exercise extreme caution not to lock out accounts. We can always ask our client for their password policy if the goal is as comprehensive an assessment as possible. If asking for the policy does not fit the expectations of the assessment or the client does not want to provide it, we should run one, max two, password spraying attempts (regardless of whether we are internal or external) and wait over an hour between attempts if we indeed decide to attempt two. While most organizations will have a lockout threshold of 5 bad password attempts, a lockout duration of 30 minutes and accounts will automatically unlock, we cannot always count on this being normal. I have seen plenty of organizations with a lockout threshold of 3, requiring an admin to intervene and unlock accounts manually."

We do not want to be the pentester that locks out every account in the organization!
