Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Check if ASLR is on:
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

Check also for NX:
checksec <<program>>

Summarizing: You will use gdb to see where the program crashes. Then, adding the function that you want in the treshold (in this case, "system" function to execute "/bin/sh"). The ldd thing is to figure out were in memory is the C function "system" to execute "/bin/sh". Because the vulnerable program runs with suid as root, the /bin/sh will create a new shell with "root" privileges.

gdb program

In another tab: 
msf-pattern_create -l 400 (to create random strings)
msf-pattern_offset -q <<the string>>

In gdb program:
run <string from msf-pattern_create>
Take the result and check with the above msf-pattern_offset. You just found now where to put the payload.
