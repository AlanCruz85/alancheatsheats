Take a look at this lab:

Summarizing: You will use gdb to see where the program crashes. Then, adding the function that you want in the treshold (in this case, "system" function to execute "/bin/sh"). The ldd thing is to figure out were in memory is the C function "system" to execute "/bin/sh". Because the vulnerable program runs with suid as root, the /bin/sh will create a new shell with "root" privileges.
