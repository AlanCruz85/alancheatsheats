XSS ATTACKS

What is CSP (content security policy)?

CSP is a browser security mechanism that aims to mitigate XSS and some other attacks. It works by restricting the resources (such as scripts and images) that a page can load and restricting whether a page can be framed by other pages.

To enable CSP, a response needs to include an HTTP response header called Content-Security-Policy with a value containing the policy. The policy itself consists of one or more directives, separated by semicolons. 

Mitigating XSS attacks using CSP

The following directive will only allow scripts to be loaded from the same origin as the page itself:
script-src 'self'

The following directive will only allow scripts to be loaded from a specific domain:
script-src https://scripts.normal-website.com

CLICKJACKING

Protecting against clickjacking using CSP

The following directive will only allow the page to be framed by other pages from the same origin:
frame-ancestors 'self'

The following directive will prevent framing altogether:
frame-ancestors 'none'

Using content security policy to prevent clickjacking is more flexible than using the X-Frame-Options header because you can specify multiple domains and use wildcards. For example:
frame-ancestors 'self' https://normal-website.com https://*.robust-website.com
