<<Goal: to bypass security controls IN THE PROXY>>

Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP specification provides two different ways to specify where a request ends: the Content-Length header and the Transfer-Encoding header.

The Content-Length header is straightforward: it specifies the length of the message body in bytes. For example:

Content-Length: 11

The Transfer-Encoding header can be used to specify that the message body uses chunked encoding. This means that the message body contains one or more chunks of data. Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents. The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero. For example:

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Since the HTTP specification provides two different methods for specifying the length of HTTP messages, it is possible for a single message to use both methods at once, such that they conflict with each other. The HTTP specification attempts to prevent this problem by stating that if both the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present, then the Content-Length header should be ignored. This might be sufficient to avoid ambiguity when only a single server is in play, but not when two or more servers are chained together. In this situation, problems can arise for two reasons:

If the front-end and back-end servers behave differently in relation to the (possibly obfuscated) Transfer-Encoding header, then they might disagree about the boundaries between successive requests, leading to request smuggling vulnerabilities.

Ex: If proxy uses transfer-encoding, will think that all in the below is only one request. But if the server uses content-length, will think that are 2 requests. So, the second request bypassed the proxy and its rules.
(need to change, in burp, the option: update content-length)
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4100b70371abe6c07a8353008700a6.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15
