What are Host header injections?

A host header injection exploits the vulnerability of some websites to accept host headers indiscriminately without validating or altogether escaping them. 

This is dangerous because many applications rely on the host header to generate links, import scripts, determine the proper redirect address, generate password reset links, etc. So when an application retrieves the host header, it may end up serving malicious content in the response injected there.

Example: you put a malicious website in the host header, and that website can be used to create links related to the victim site (to reset password, for example). So, when a client clicks on "reset password", he will be redirected to your website.
