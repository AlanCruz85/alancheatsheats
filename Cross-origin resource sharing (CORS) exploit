CORS is related with Same Origin Policy (SOP). Same origin policy is a browser security feature that restricts a document or script loaded by one origin, to access or interact with documents or scripts from another origin. An origin consists of protocol, host and port. 

Sumarising to understand better: 
SOP prevents one website to read informaton from other, but allows the action to happen.
Ex: If I send a POST request from site1.com to site2.com, trying to change information about an email address, the values sent in my requisition (cookies, for instance) will not be read by site2.com, but the action (change email) will happen. So, SOP it is not enough to prevent CSRF. Anti-CSRF token is better to prevent CSRF.

CORS exploit is about sending a request from vulnerable.com to malicious.com and, them, being able to receive and read interesting information (cookies, for instance, or sessionid). REMEMBER: in HackTheBox, the only way to grep cookies there is using XSS, and it is like that because SOP doesn't allow that those informations are sent in a normal request.
