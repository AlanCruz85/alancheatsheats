XOR cypher

In python (see table below): ^ 	XOR 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
Wich means: comparing two bits, if they are both 0 or both 1 = resulto is 0
                                if they are different = result is 1

Python Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
Operator 	Name 	Description
&  	AND 	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
| 	OR 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^ 	XOR 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~  	NOT 	Inverts all the bits
<< 	Zero fill left shift 	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>> 	Signed right shift 	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
