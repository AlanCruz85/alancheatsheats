Review the following initial switch configuration tasks:

-Configure the device name.
    hostname name

-Secure user EXEC mode.
    line console 0
    password password
    login

-Secure remote Telnet / SSH access.
    line vty 0 15
    password password
    login

-Secure privileged EXEC mode.
    enable secret password

-Secure all passwords in the config file.
    service password-encryption

-Provide legal notification.
    banner motd #No unauthorized access allowed!#

-Configure the management SVI.
    interface vlan 1
    ip address ip-address subnet-mask
    no shutdown

-Save the configuration.

Enable SSH

Before configuring SSH, the switch must be minimally configured with a unique hostname and the correct network connectivity settings.

Step 1. Verify SSH support.
Use the show ip ssh command to verify that the switch supports SSH. If the switch is not running an IOS that supports cryptographic features, this command is unrecognized.

Step 2. Configure the IP domain.
Configure the IP domain name of the network using the ip domain-name domain-name global configuration mode command. In the example configuration below, the domain-name value is cisco.com.

Step 3. Generate RSA key pairs.
Not all versions of the IOS default to SSH version 2, and SSH version 1 has known security flaws. To configure SSH version 2, issue the ip ssh version 2 global configuration mode command. Generating an RSA key pair automatically enables SSH. Use the crypto key generate rsa global configuration mode command to enable the SSH server on the switch and generate an RSA key pair. When generating RSA keys, the administrator is prompted to enter a modulus length. The sample configuration in the figure uses a modulus size of 1,024 bits. A longer modulus length is more secure, but it takes more time to generate and to use.
Note: To delete the RSA key pair, use the crypto key zeroize rsa global configuration mode command. After the RSA key pair is deleted, the SSH server is automatically disabled.

Step 4. Configure user authentication.
The SSH server can authenticate users locally or use an authentication server. To use the local authentication method, create a username and password pair with the username username secret password global configuration mode command. In the example, the user admin is assigned the password ccna.

Step 5. Configure the vty lines.
Enable the SSH protocol on the vty lines using the transport input ssh line configuration mode command. The Catalyst 2960 has vty lines ranging from 0 to 15. This configuration prevents non-SSH (such as Telnet) connections and limits the switch to accept only SSH connections. Use the line vty global configuration mode command and then the login local line configuration mode command to require local authentication for SSH connections from the local username database.

Step 6. Enable SSH version 2.
By default, SSH supports both versions 1 and 2. When supporting both versions, this is shown in the show ip ssh output as supporting version 1.99. Version 1 has known vulnerabilities. For this reason, it is recommended to enable only version 2. Enable SSH version using the ip ssh version 2 global configuration command.


Ex:         
            
            S1# show ip ssh
            SSH Disabled - version 1.99
            %Please create RSA keys (of at least 768 bits size) to enable SSH v2.
            Authentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3
            S1# configure terminal
            S1(config)# ip domain-name cisco.com
            S1(config)# crypto key generate rsa
            The name for the keys will be: S1.cisco.com
            ...
            How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024
            ...
            S1(config)# username admin secret ccna
            S1(config-line)# line vty 0 15
            S1(config-line)# transport input ssh
            S1(config-line)# login local
            S1(config-line)# exit
            S1(config)# ip ssh version 2
            S1(config)# exit
            S1#
