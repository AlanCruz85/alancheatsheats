Windows(Microsoft) Defender:
PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus
RealTimeProtectionEnabled parameter is set to True, means Defender is enabled on the system.

AppLocker:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

PowerShell Constrained Language Mode:
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

LAPS
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
The LAPSToolkit greatly facilitates this with several functions. The Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.
