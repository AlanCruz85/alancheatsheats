 JSON web tokens (JWTs) are a standardized format for sending cryptographically signed JSON data between systems. They can theoretically contain any kind of data, but are most commonly used to send information ("claims") about users as part of authentication, session handling, and access control mechanisms.

Unlike with classic session tokens, all of the data that a server needs is stored client-side within the JWT itself. This makes JWTs a popular choice for highly distributed websites where users need to interact seamlessly with multiple back-end servers. 

 The server that issues the token typically generates the signature by hashing the header and payload. In some cases, they also encrypt the resulting hash. Either way, this process involves a secret signing key. This mechanism provides a way for servers to verify that none of the data within the token has been tampered with since it was issued:

 As the signature is directly derived from the rest of the token, changing a single byte of the header or payload results in a mismatched signature.

1 - change the "payload" variable;
2 - change the "alg" value to "none";

Both works if the webserver doesn't assess the jwt, only decodes it.

MANIPULATING VALUES - HS256 - SIMETRIC KEY

First, bruteforce the "secret" key used to compute the signature.

After finding the key, edit the field inside the JSON Web Token as you prefer.

Finally, finish the token by signing it with the previously retrieved "secret" key.

JWT KEY CONFUSION - CHANGING FROM ASSIMETRIC KEY TO SIMETRIC KEY
Practicing in htb challenge 'Under construction', I learned a little about key confusiong.
Open jwt.io and copy the public key, replacing all the '\n' with 'enter'. After, paste it on the 'verify signature' part.

python3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -I -pc name -pv "payload" -S hs256 -k public.key
Here, you are using the public key to validate your credentials, changing the validation method to simetric key (hs256, instead of rs256)
