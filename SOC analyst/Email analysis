1 - See the raw message, and check, among the "received" headers, the one were the SMTP server for your application (ex: google for gmail) received the message; That IP address that sent the email can't be spoofed (need to check this info). 
  
  Here, you will see that the ESMPT (enhanced SMTP) was used, and that the TLS protocol was user for encryption (normal behaviour)
  Ex: << by mx.google.com with ESMTPS id z1-20020a7bc7c1000000b003f17bc80e4fsi1299897wmk.196.2023.04.20.05.22.55
         version=TLS1_3

2 - Check the "Return-Path", if matches the "From" header. The "from" header can be spoofed.

The video explains better.
