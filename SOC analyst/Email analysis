1 - See the raw message. Check the SPF header, if the ip address that sent the email is recognized by the domain. It should be "SPF:pass". If it is "SPF:none", it means that it wasn't possible to confirm if the ip address is recognized.

 Ex: << Received-SPF: pass (google[.]com: domain of example[.]com designates xxx[.]xxx[.]xxx[.]xxx as permitted sender)

Check that IP address that sent the email in Virus Total and other sources;
 
2 - Check the "Return-Path/Reply-to" headers, if match the "From" header. The "from" header can be spoofed.
3 - You can check the "Content-Type" headers. There, you can find the body text, with the html codes (for instance, if there are any links), and you can find also the attachments.
      If it is "Content-Type: text/plain" or "Content-Type: text/html", so it is in the body text. It can be encoded (Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64), or not (Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit >> 7 bit I think is for ASCII <<).
      If it is other thing (like Content-Type: application/pdf), I think it is the attachment. Problably will be base 64 encoded.

Difference between ESMTP and SMTP:

How is ESMTP different from SMTP?

ESMTP was introduced as an extension to SMTP. Many new functions were enabled to save bandwidth and protect servers: 

    Users were not verified in SMTP as a result of massive-scale scam emails being sent. But in ESMTP authentication of sender is done.
    On encryption of mail-in SMTP but in ESMTP SSL encryption is done.
    We cannot attach a Multimedia file in SMTP directly without the help of MMIE but in ESMTP it can be done.
    We can also reduce size of email in ESMTP but not in SMTP.
    The main identification feature for ESMTP clients is to open a transmission with the command EHLO (Extended HELLO), rather than HELO.
