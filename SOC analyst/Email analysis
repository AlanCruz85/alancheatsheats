1 - See the raw message, and check, among the "received" headers, the one were the SMTP server for your application (ex: google for gmail) received the message; That IP address that sent the email can't be spoofed (need to check this info). 
  
  Here, you will see that the ESMPT (enhanced SMTP) was used, and that the TLS protocol was user for encryption (normal behaviour)
  Ex: << by mx.google.com with ESMTPS id z1-20020a7bc7c1000000b003f17bc80e4fsi1299897wmk.196.2023.04.20.05.22.55
         version=TLS1_3

2 - Check the "Return-Path", if matches the "From" header. The "from" header can be spoofed.

The video explains better.

How is ESMTP different from SMTP?

ESMTP was introduced as an extension to SMTP. Many new functions were enabled to save bandwidth and protect servers: 

    Users were not verified in SMTP as a result of massive-scale scam emails being sent. But in ESMTP authentication of sender is done.
    On encryption of mail-in SMTP but in ESMTP SSL encryption is done.
    We cannot attach a Multimedia file in SMTP directly without the help of MMIE but in ESMTP it can be done.
    We can also reduce size of email in ESMTP but not in SMTP.
    The main identification feature for ESMTP clients is to open a transmission with the command EHLO (Extended HELLO), rather than HELO.
