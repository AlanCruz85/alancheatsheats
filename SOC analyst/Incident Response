Compliance (laws and rules) >>> Security policies >>> Incident response policies >>> Incident response playbook
Playbook is what will guide me day-by-day (walkthrough).

Incident response policies are related to the goals of the organization:
Confidentiality, availability and integrity. If confidentiality is more important for one company, his policies will be diferent to a company that has integrity as most important thing. 

IoC (indicator of compromise - it is a forensinc tool) will help you to evaluate the possible spread of the contamination (Containment and Erradication steps)

Containment (you need to choose which one according to the policies):
Shutdown>> Lost all memory evidence; alert the attacker; maybe jeopardise the business
Just disconnect from network, but keep running>> alert the attacker; maybe jeopardise the business
Let it run while do assessment>> the attacker can do more damage. If the server is running in a DMZ, it is easier to let it run

Maybe if confidentiality is most important >> shutdown or disconnect; and availability is most important >> let it run
