It is important to contain both the Host machine and the User account (Active Directory).
On an Active Directory, there are files and folders that a user carries with him regardles of the Host machine.
See this video, for better understanding how it happens, and how a roaming profile works:

All the User's profile may be copied to the share folder.
    Ex: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Favorites...
      
    "These folders are commonly redirected to a network location or a designated file server to ensure that users can access their data and settings from any machine within the Active Directory domain."
    "By default, the contents of the "Documents" and "Desktop" folders are typically set to roam with the user. This means that the user's documents and files stored in these folders will be synchronized and available on different machines within the Active Directory domain."

The roaming profiles are saved in an Share Folder (*SMB, just a reminder).
Ex: In the Active Directory Users and Computer >> Users >> Alan >> Properties >> Profile path, I can put the share folder (\\testing\profiles\alan)
