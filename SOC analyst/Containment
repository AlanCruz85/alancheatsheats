It is important to contain noth the Host machine and the User account (Active Directory).
On an Active Directory, there are files and folders that an user carries with him regardles of the Host machine.
According to ChatGpt, they are:

    1 - Documents: The "Documents" folder, which contains user's personal documents, such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs.
    2 - Desktop: The "Desktop" folder, which holds the user's desktop shortcuts and files.
    3 - Favorites: The "Favorites" folder, where the user's Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge bookmarks are stored.
    4 - AppData: The "AppData" folder, which includes application-specific data, settings, and configurations for various installed programs.
    5 - Start Menu: The "Start Menu" folder, which contains the user's Start Menu shortcuts and settings.
    
    "These folders are commonly redirected to a network location or a designated file server to ensure that users can access their data and settings from any machine within the Active Directory domain."
    "By default, the contents of the "Documents" and "Desktop" folders are typically set to roam with the user. This means that the user's documents and files stored in these folders will be synchronized and available on different machines within the Active Directory domain."
