Anti-virus: to analyse files;
Firewall and proxy: to analyse subjects; firewall sees ip and ports, while proxy is used to see the applications accessed (denying access to Netflix, for example);
IDS: to analyse behavior and possible behavior (analyses packets);

"WAF (Web Application Firewall) is the technology used to secure web-based applications. The analysis of firewall or IDS/IPS logs alone are often not sufficient for the detection of web-based attacks. The main reasons for this are the SSL offload issue and the control of the data in the payload (data) part of the web request.
In networks equipped with WAF, requests from end users reach WAF first over the internet. Then the WAF inspects the request, and makes the decision whether it will be transferred to the Web Server or not. One of the biggest advantages of WAFs here is that it can perform SSL Off-load, which helps examine the content of HTTPS traffic. WAF without SSL Offloading capability cannot provide a full effective protection as it wonâ€™t be able to inspect the payload (data) part of the HTTPS communication."

WAF: XXS, SSTI, SQLI;

SIEM / IDS


An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or system for malicious activity and policy violations. 

Most IDS will detect suspicious activity via one of the following detection methods:
    Signature-based detection:
    Anomaly-based detection:
    Reputation-based detection:
    
    
SIEM and IDS are generally used together to detect and prevent unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data.  

Like a SIEM, an IDS can keep event logs. However, they don't have the capability to centralize and correlate event data across different systems. That's why IDS tools are used to detect malicious or suspicious activity, which is then used to alert a SIEM. From there, the incident response team can analyze the data in one place to understand whether it poses a threat.

SOC center are composed of PPT (people, process and technology)
 Process are related to: Planning, detection, containment, erradication and recovery;
 People: SOC analysts, Incident responder, Threat hunter, pentesters...
 Technology: SIEM, IDS, WAF, Proxy, firewall...
 
 Relation between people and technology:
 Human element, security analytics, and artificial inteligence
 Human element basically is about decision making based on abstration, common sense, moral...
 analytics is about what SIEM does, basically;
 artificial inteligence is about machine learning (sees common behaviours, for example)
