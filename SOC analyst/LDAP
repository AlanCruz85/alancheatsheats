LDAP supports many operations which define how to interact with the LDAP server instance, such as creating, retrieving, updating, searching for, and deleting objects in the directory. Some operations are below.
LDAP add
LDAP search
LDAP modify
LDAP delete
LDAP bind

Authentication is supplied in the "LDAP bind" operation. There are three different authentication methods that can be configured for LDAPv3.

First, LDAP bind, for authentication. After, you can do the others.
LDAP search: 3 criteria are passed: baseObject (for instance, the dc), the scope, and the filter. Most important for me to analyze are filter and baseObject. You can see those on the pcap file (above website for full explanation).
