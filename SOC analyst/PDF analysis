    Objects with JS code (2): [26, 33]
            Suspicious elements:
                    /OpenAction (2): [26, 17]
                    /Launch (1): [26]
                    
Here, pay attention to the 'OpenAction' part. It means that, once the file is opened, it will launch the actions mencioned (objects 26 and 17)

You can use the command "object 26" to see what it does.
