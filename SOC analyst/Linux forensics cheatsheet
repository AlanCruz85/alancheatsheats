In general, best folders to check info are:
/etc
/var/logs or /var/<application info>
/home/<user> And /root (you can check on passwd file where is the home path for the user that you are investigating)
(With Windows is similar: config (for Registry info mostly), winevt and user folders, amongst others)

And /tmp , /bin for something unusual
