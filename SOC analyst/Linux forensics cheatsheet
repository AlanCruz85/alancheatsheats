### CHECKLIST ###
In general, best folders to check info are:

/etc
/var/logs or /var/<application info>
/home/<user> And /root (you can check on passwd file where is the home path for the user that you are investigating)
(With Windows is similar: config (for Registry info mostly), winevt and user folders, amongst others)

/tmp or /var/tmp are also interesting, since malware usually use those folders (broad permissions). 
/bin for something unusual

Evidence of execution

Authentication logs:
Location: /var/log/auth.log* |grep -i COMMAND;
the grep can be used to filter the results. 

Bash history:
Location: /home/<user>/.bash_history

Vim history:
Location: /home/<user>/.viminfo

Log files

Syslogs:
Location: /var/log/syslog
Use grep or similar utility to filter results as per requirement

Authentication logs:
Location: /var/log/auth.log
Use grep or similar utility to filter results as per requirement

Third-party logs:
Location: /var/log
Logs for each third-party application can be found in their specific directories in this location

For last IPs that connected:
/var/log/lastlog

About Ips used by host:
cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i dhcp

Persistence mechanism

Cron jobs:
Location: 
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/user  <<each user will have a file here (crontab file), it's where a cronjob is created when the command 'crontab -e'>>
/etc/crontab <<more related to system cronjobs>>

The difference is that the crontab command is the interface provided by the system for users to manipulate their crontabs. The /etc/crontab file is a special case file used to implement a system-wide crontab. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/$USER (or whatever the path happens to be) is an implementation detail.

Services:
Location: /etc/init.d/
Registered services are present in this directory. When a machine starts.
Another file: /etc/services

Bash shell startup:
Location: /home/<user>/.bashrc for each user
Locations: /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile for system wide settings.
