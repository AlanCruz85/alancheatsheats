You can achieve similar functionality to the sort and uniq commands in Linux using the Sort-Object and Get-Unique cmdlets, respectively.

#### Split (To get columns)
Your-Command | ForEach-Object { $_.Split()[1] }
Or: ForEach-Object { $_.Line.Split()[1] }

____________________________________________
## Sort:
    To sort the lines of a text file or the output of a command, you can use the Sort-Object cmdlet. Here's an example:

    powershell

Get-Content -Path "YourFilePath.txt" | Sort-Object

This command reads the content of the file specified by "YourFilePath.txt" and sorts the lines in ascending order. If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the -Descending parameter:

Get-Content -Path "YourFilePath.txt" | Sort-Object -Descending
_______________________________________________
### Unique:
To get unique lines from a text file or the output of a command, you can use the Get-Unique cmdlet. Here's an example:

Get-Content -Path "YourFilePath.txt" | Get-Unique

This command reads the content of the file specified by "YourFilePath.txt" and returns only the unique lines.

### Count

If you want to count the occurrences of each unique line, you can use the Group-Object cmdlet:

Get-Content -Path "YourFilePath.txt" | Group-Object | ForEach-Object { $_.Name }

This will return a list of unique lines along with their counts.
