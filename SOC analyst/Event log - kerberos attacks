A SOC analyst would be looking through thousands of logs. So, to greatly reduce the noise and only look for indications of AS-REP roasting attack, analysts should use queries only to look for Event ID 4768 with the ticket encryption type of “0x17” and pre-authentication type “0”. These events should be definitely further looked into and investigated.

So to hunt for indications of AS-REP roasting accounts, analyst should look for:

1- Event ID 4768 on Domain Controller
2- Ticket Encryption Type of “0x17”
3- Pre-Authentication Type of "0"

KERBEROASTING

So, to summarize, here's how you can detect kerberoasting activities from event logs:

1- Event ID 4768 with encryption type “0x17”.
2- Above event is immediately followed by Event ID 4769 also with encryption type “0x17”.
3- The account name requesting the service ticket is a domain user account and not a service account or computer account (starting with $).
4- Filter for Audit success keywords in event 4769 (Meaning the attacker got the hash).
5- In some cases, many requests for service tickets in a short period of time.

Hunting for LDAP Enumerations (Bloodhound/Sharphound)

So, to summarize:

1- Enter CANARY objects. A viable solution to the problem above is to create user accounts, computer names, groups etc. in the Active Directory that are not used by anybody and instead just play the role of dummy accounts/computer/groups. Then enable auditing on these dummy objects and whenever an attacker uses automated tools like bloodhound, these dummy objects would also be queried from LDAP, causing the event to be logged without any performance issues. 
2- Filter for event ID 4662.
3- If too many events occur in a very short time of period then, it may be a strong indication for an LDAP enumeration has taken place.
