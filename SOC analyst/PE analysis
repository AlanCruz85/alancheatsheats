Checking the headers, to see if it's packed:

    Unconventional section names
    EXECUTE permissions for multiple sections
    High Entropy, approaching 8, for some sections.
    A significant difference between SizeOfRawData and Misc_VirtualSize of some PE sections
    Very few import functions

RUNNING THE MALWARE ON THE LAB

1 - Always check if the machines are completely isolated in that internal network. Ex: ping 8.8.8.8; ping 1.1.1.1; ping google.com

You can start using PEstudio, to make it easier to do basic static analysis. But, to filter, it is better to use Floss + findstr /i
You can use Ghidra or Cutter to do a more detailed static anslysis (dissasembly and decompiler)

You can use 2 VMs: A remnux to run inetsim with DNS enabled; A windows VM with Flare Package installed, and also sysinternals.

Remnux: Inetsim and Wireshark running (capture network connections);
Windows Flare VM: Procmon (to see the processes that will run), and with TCPView, to see an overview of the connections established/open (will make it easier to analyse the Wireshark info)

Start analyzing the information on Wireshark and on Sysmon, to get a good overview.
