From TryHackMe:

After finding the vulnerable print server, the attacker can then execute the exploit code (similar to the Python script in the previous task), which will load the malicious DLL file to exploit the vulnerability. More specifically, the exploit code will call the RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() function from the authenticated user account and load the malicious DLL file in order to exploit the vulnerability. The pcAddPrinterDriverEx() function is used to install a printer driver on the system.

1-  Search for the spoolsv.exe process launching rundll32.exe as a child process without any command-line arguments.
    Hunt for suspicious spoolsv.exe child processes (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, etc.)

2-  Check the dlls used/created. It seems that the malicious .dll file will be stored here: C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3

    You can look for the following Event IDs, to try to get the above info:

    Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational (Event ID 316) - look for "Printer driver [file] for Windows x64 Version-3 was added or updated. Files:- UNIDRV.DLL, AddUser.dll, AddUser.dll. No user action is required.‚Äù
    Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin (Event ID 808) - A security event source has attempted to register (can detect unsigned drivers and malicious DLLs loaded by spoolsv.exe)
    Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational (Event ID 811) - Logs the information regarding failed operations. The event will provide information about the full path of the dropped DLL.
    Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient/Security (Event ID 31017) - This Event ID can also be used to detect unsigned drivers loaded by spoolsv.exe.
    Windows System (Event ID 7031) - Service Stop Operations (This event ID will show you unexpected termination of print spooler service).
