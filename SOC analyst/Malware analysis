While doing dynamic analysis, you should carefully examine the following events.

    Network Connections
    File Events
    Process Events
    Registry Events

STATIC ANALYSIS

To check the imports made by the code to the Windows API (you can use "pestudio" to see this):

RUNNING THE MALWARE ON THE LAB

1 - Always check if the machines are completely isolated in that internal network. Ex: ping 8.8.8.8; ping google.com

You can start using pestudio, to make it easier to do static analysis.

You can use 2 VMs: A remnux to run inetsim with DNS enabled; A windows VM with Flare Package installed, and also sysinternals.

Remnux: Inetsim and Wireshark running (capture network connections);
Windows Flare VM: Procmon (to see the processes that will run), and with TCPView, to see an overview of the connections established/open (will make it easier to analyse the Wireshark info)
