SIEM / IDS

The main difference between a security information and event management (SIEM) solution and an intrusion detection system (IDS) is that SIEM tools allow users to take preventive actions against cyberattacks while IDS only detects and reports events.

Security information and event management (SIEM) is an approach to cybersecurity combining:

    Security information management (SIM): Collects log data for analysis, alerting responsible individuals of security threats and events 
    Security event management (SEM): Conducts real-time system monitoring, notifies network admins of important issues, and establishes event correlations

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or system for malicious activity and policy violations. 

Most IDS will detect suspicious activity via one of the following detection methods:
    Signature-based detection:
    Anomaly-based detection:
    Reputation-based detection:
    
IDS systems can range from single computers to large networks and are commonly grouped into two types:
    Network intrusion detection system (NIDS):   
    Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS):
    
SIEM and IDS are generally used together to detect and prevent unauthorized access or exposure of sensitive data.  

Like a SIEM, an IDS can keep event logs. However, they don't have the capability to centralize and correlate event data across different systems. That's why IDS tools are used to detect malicious or suspicious activity, which is then used to alert a SIEM. From there, the incident response team can analyze the data in one place to understand whether it poses a threat.
