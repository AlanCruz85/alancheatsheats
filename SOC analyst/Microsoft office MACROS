1- oleid NameOfFile 
	(get the initial info, if there are VBA macros or XLM macros)
  
2- olevba NameOfFile 
	(for VBA macros)
	olevba --deobf --reveal NameOfFile
		(to deobfuscate the code)
    
3- xlmdeobfuscator -f NameOfFile
	(for xlm macros)
	
If the commands are obfuscated:
	olevba --deobf --reveal invitation.docm << from HTB challenge "Halloween", a very good one to practice understanding basic obfuscation>>
  
If you need more information, you can open the microsoft office files using libreoffice (for instance, to open an Excel file using Calc), because the macros are written using different program languages (NEED TO READ MORE ABOUT THAT, TO BE SURE). This is like doing static analysis.

Last possibility, you can do dynamic analysis.
