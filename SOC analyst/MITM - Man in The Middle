"Responder allows us to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks by poisoning the responses during NetNTLM authentication, tricking the client into talking to you instead of the actual server they wanted to connect to. On a real LAN, Responder will attempt to poison any  Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR),  NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS), and Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) requests that are detected. On large Windows networks, these protocols allow hosts to perform their own local DNS resolution for all hosts on the same local network. Rather than overburdening network resources such as the DNS servers, hosts can first attempt to determine if the host they are looking for is on the same local network by sending out LLMNR requests and seeing if any hosts respond. The NBT-NS is the precursor protocol to LLMNR, and WPAD requests are made to try and find a proxy for future HTTP(s) connections.

Since these protocols rely on requests broadcasted on the local network, our rogue device would also receive these requests. Usually, these requests would simply be dropped since they were not meant for our host. However, Responder will actively listen to the requests and send poisoned responses telling the requesting host that our IP is associated with the requested hostname. By poisoning these requests, Responder attempts to force the client to connect to our AttackBox. In the same line, it starts to host several servers such as SMB, HTTP, SQL, and others to capture these requests and force authentication. "

So, it seems that ARP poisoning and DNS poisoning/hijacking can be performed in the LAN. If the attacker is in the same LAN as the target, it can pretend to be the destination by both methods.

About DNS Spoofing - The techniques are:
  1-Rogue DHCP Server;
  2-DNS Poisoning, that leads also to Cache Poisoning - This one interests me more, it's related to MITM. The attacker replies DNS queries pretending to be the DNS (DNS Poisoning). Then, the DNS Cache will be with the wrong values (Poisoning attack).

Tools:

With Ettercap/Bettercap (ARP Poisoning, DNS poisoning, HTTPS Downgrading and HSTS Hijacking), you can choose the default gateway and the target (providing those IP addresses). Then, with wireshark, you will be able to see the packets.
*It seems that all starts with the ARP Poisoning. So, you can check, first, the arp table from the victim.

With Responder (LLMNR - Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution), it's more about just getting the hash (NTLM protocol).
