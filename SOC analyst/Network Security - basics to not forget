Defense-in-depth (zero trust) model:
    << You can think about: (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) + (Data, Network, Software, Hardware/physical devices), to plan how to deploy the cybersecurity architecture as a whole.
    
    Segmentation: creating subnetworks to better secure and monitore the environment;
    Monitoring: using packet sniffers (like wireshark) to monitor all the communication (inside-outside and lateral communications);
    Security: protect Data, each subnetwork, Software and Physical devices
              >>using firewalls/IDS/IPS to secure communications (network);
              >>using cryptography, backups, authentication to secure data;
              >>physical security (cameras, guards, control access...), antivirus, security patchs, for physical devices;
              >>protecting software (see owasp).
              
              About availability >> all the elements above need redundancy.
