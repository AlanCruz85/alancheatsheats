Defense-in-depth (zero trust) model:
    << You can think about: (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) + (Data, Network, Software, Hardware/physical devices), to plan how to deploy the cybersecurity architecture as a whole.
    
    Segmentation: creating subnetworks to better secure and monitore the environment;
    Monitoring: using packet sniffers (like wireshark) to monitor all the communication (inside-outside and lateral communications);
    Security: protect Data, each subnetwork, Software and Physical devices
              >>using firewalls/IDS/IPS to secure communications (network);
              >>using cryptography, backups, authentication to secure data;
              >>physical security (cameras, guards, control access...), antivirus, security patchs, for physical devices;
              >>protecting software (see owasp).
              
              About availability >> all the elements above need redundancy.

Network access control (NAC) systems

Because BYOD and IoT networking greatly expand the network attack surface, NAC system automation features make focused control of network access by such devices practical. The NAC system is configured to enforce organizational policies. The relevant policies are enacted to permit or deny network access according to a wide range of factors that the NAC system detects on the devices that are attempting access. Without NAC systems it would be impossible for cybersecurity personnel to evaluate the thousands of devices that could attempt to access the network.

NAC is an important component of a zero-trust security architecture that enforces security policy compliance with all devices and users that attempt to access the network.

Router configuration (ACL)
Source: https://skillsforall.com/launch?id=8462b32d-0a49-4d7a-b881-498eb3be42cc

ACLs can be used to mitigate many network threats, such as IP address spoofing and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Most DoS attacks use some type of spoofing. IP address spoofing overrides the normal packet creation process by inserting a custom IP header with a different source IP address. Attackers can hide their identity by spoofing the source IP address.

There are many well-known classes of IP addresses that should never be seen as source IP addresses for traffic entering an organizationâ€™s network. For example, in the figure the S0/0/0 interface is attached to the internet and should never accept inbound packets from the following addresses:

    All zeros addresses
    Broadcast addresses
    Local host addresses (127.0.0.0/8)
    Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) addresses (169.254.0.0/16)
    Reserved private addresses (RFC 1918)
    IP multicast address range (224.0.0.0/4)
