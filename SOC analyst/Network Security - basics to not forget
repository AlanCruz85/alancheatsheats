Defense-in-depth (zero trust) model:
    << You can think about: (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) + (Data, Network, Software, Hardware/physical devices), to plan how to deploy the cybersecurity architecture as a whole.
    
    Segmentation: creating subnetworks to better secure and monitore the environment;
    Monitoring: using packet sniffers (like wireshark) to monitor all the communication (inside-outside and lateral communications);
    Security: protect Data, each subnetwork, Software and Physical devices
              >>using firewalls/IDS/IPS to secure communications (network);
              >>using cryptography, backups, authentication to secure data;
              >>physical security (cameras, guards, control access...), antivirus, security patchs, for physical devices;
              >>protecting software (see owasp).
              
              About availability >> all the elements above need redundancy.

Network access control (NAC) systems

Because BYOD and IoT networking greatly expand the network attack surface, NAC system automation features make focused control of network access by such devices practical. The NAC system is configured to enforce organizational policies. The relevant policies are enacted to permit or deny network access according to a wide range of factors that the NAC system detects on the devices that are attempting access. Without NAC systems it would be impossible for cybersecurity personnel to evaluate the thousands of devices that could attempt to access the network.

NAC is an important component of a zero-trust security architecture that enforces security policy compliance with all devices and users that attempt to access the network.
