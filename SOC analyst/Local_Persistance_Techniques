Interesting different techniques portrayed in the lab:
https://tryhackme.com/r/room/windowslocalpersistence

YOU NEED ADMIN ACCOUNT FOR THE BELLOW TECHNIQUES.
# Adding user in localgroup "Backup Operators"
Then, you can download SAM and System hive to get the pasword hashes;

# Using secedit to give to an user privileges (instead of adding to a local group). Or using the GUI "Local Security Policy". 
secedit /export /cfg config.inf <<to download and change the config file, adding the privileges>>
secedit /import /cfg newconfig.inf /db config.sdb
secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf

# RID Hijacking
Changing the RID of an user, updating with the RID related to Admin (500).
You need to run regedit as System. So:
PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit
HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\
Find the user and change the "F" value. More details in the lab.
