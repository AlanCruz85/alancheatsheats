INVESTIGATING WINDOWS MACHINE:


#### When checking process tree info, pay attention to the following columns:
THREADS: The high number of threads compared to other processes might indicate the program performs many tasks, potentially consuming significant system resources.
HANDLES: The large number under “Hnds” (handles) suggests the process has opened many files or resources, which could be a sign of abnormal activity.

#### for info about the user that ran a process: windows.sessions
#### you can use "yarascan -Y" plugin to search recursively for a string (like 'grep' or 'Select-Strings')####
#### you can use the modules 'shimcache' and 'userassist' for PEs/files executed. 
'Pstree' and others display the process that were ran before the machine being shut down. So, maybe you will not see all the information there. 
<< For instance: the memory image was taken on March 22. But maybe some relevant process that was run on March 07 will not be displayed there, because the machine was restarted.>>
#### about memdump, after, use 'strings' with '-e l', to convert to utf-16. You will get more information.

To get Outlook emails downloaded:
vol2 -f win7ecorpoffice2010-36b02ed3.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000007d4d9450 --dump-dir='pst' -u
<<pay attention to the '-u' parameter.>>
Then, you can use "pffexport" to export the .dat file.

EPROCESS, that points to PEB and VAD.
To sum up: EPROCESS contains basic info about the process (PID, parent process). PEB contains more details (command used, .dll files loaded, the path were the file is located). VAD is similar to PEB.
PEB is related to process memory, while VAD is related to kernel memory.

"CommitCharge: This value specifies the number of committed pages in the region and pairing with physical addresses are being done. When there is no CommitCharge, then it means that memory has only been reserved but not paired with physical addresses."

Malfind searches for VAD protection (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE). Any executable that is normally loaded will have a memory protection of PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY.
You can use "vadinfo" to dig deeper and see the .dll files that received the writing privileges.

psxview and ldrmodules can be used to check discrepancies between PEB and VAD.
Psxview can find processes that have been previously terminated or have been hidden or unlinked.
<<<< check the columns ‘pslist’ and ‘psscan’ to see if they have any responses as ‘False’. If so, it indicates that the process was hidden in our initial scan.>>>

The ldrmodules plugin can be used to list the loaded modules (DLLs) in a process, and it can also be used to detect unlinked/hidden DLLs. 

The msxml3r.dll does not exist in any of the 3 DLL lists (InLoad, InInit, and InMem). The columns InLoad, InInit, and InMem indicates whether a module has been loaded into memory, initialized, or is currently in the process memory. If all these columns are False, it may indicate the presence of a rootkit or other malicious software that is trying to hide its presence.

INVESTIGATING LINUX MACHINE:

https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Linux-Command-Reference
+++ there is a plugin not listed in the above website: 
linux_enumerate_files

These labs made me learn a lot to use volatility for investigating linux in practice, specially doing Memory dump and using a new profile:

1 - Copy the zipped file to:
/home/kali/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux <<in my case>>. Search for '/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux' and you may find several. According to the permissions (if running vol2 with sudo or not), the right folder will be different;

2 - See if it worked with the command:
vol2 --info |grep Profiles -A 15
