The process of browser forensics typically involves the extraction and examination of web browser history, cache, and cookies. 
Browsers store user information like history, URLs visited, cache, cookies, and etc. in sqlite databases and json format. 

Here are storage paths for some other common web browsers:

Firefox: “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\”
Edge: “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\”
Opera: “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Opera Software\Opera Stable”
