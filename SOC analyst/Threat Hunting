Using yara:
1 - create an yara rule with yarGen.py
    python3 yarGen.py -m /path_to_malware_sample/
    
2 - the above will create a yargen_rules.yar file. Now:
    yara yargen_rules.yar /directory_to_be_investigated/
    
To remember the basics: https://tryhackme.com/room/yara

I could use Loki (or the payed version, Thor) first, because I can find pre-saved yara rules and other IOCs. If a malware is not detected, I could use yargen to create a new rule.

 IOC stands for Indicators of Compromise; they are artifacts of the potential compromise and host intrusion on the system or network that you need to look for when conducting threat hunting or performing incident response. 
 IOCs can be MD5, SHA1, SHA256 hashes, IP address, C2 domain, file size, filename, file path, a registry key, etc.
