It can result in:

    Path Traversal
    Symlink file overwrite
    
Path Traversal

If a vulnerable code extracts a user-supplied zip archive, that can lead to arbitrary file overwrite, where an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, based on the privileges the application is running with.

If the application code runs as root, itâ€™s game over: The attacker can overwrite critical files like passwd, shadow, .bashrc, .htpasswd, authorized_keys, etc.


Ex: 
In '/' directory, create "/app/application/blueprints"
There, create 'routes.py'
tar -czvf teste.tar.gz --absolute-names "../../../../../../../app/application/blueprints/routes.py"
